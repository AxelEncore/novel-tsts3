# Encore Tasks - Task Management Application

## Overview

**Encore Tasks** is a comprehensive task management application similar to Trello/YouGile, featuring:
- Modern Next.js application with TypeScript
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)
- Dark theme with purple/blue colors and glassmorphism design
- Kanban boards with drag-and-drop functionality
- Project and board management
- PostgreSQL database with complete schema

## Project Status

**âœ… SUCCESSFULLY CONFIGURED AND RUNNING**

The application has been successfully imported from GitHub and configured for the Replit environment with all major functionality working.

## Recent Changes (September 18, 2025)

### Database Configuration
- âœ… Configured PostgreSQL database connection for Replit environment
- âœ… Applied complete database schema with all tables (users, projects, boards, columns, tasks, sessions, etc.)
- âœ… Fixed SSL configuration for Neon (Replit's PostgreSQL service)
- âœ… Resolved database adapter initialization issues

### Authentication System
- âœ… Resolved authentication conflicts between NextAuth and custom JWT system
- âœ… Standardized on JWT authentication system
- âœ… Fixed PostgreSQL adapter to use correct Replit environment variables
- âœ… Successfully tested login functionality with admin credentials

### API Functionality
- âœ… **Project Creation API**: Fixed import issues and authentication compatibility
- âœ… **Board Creation API**: Fixed column schema mismatch (name vs title field)
- âœ… Verified API endpoints work correctly with proper authentication

### Environment Setup
- âœ… Configured Node.js environment and dependencies
- âœ… Set up development workflow running on port 5000 with proper host binding
- âœ… Updated Next.js configuration for Replit environment

## Current Architecture

### Authentication Flow
- Custom JWT-based authentication system
- Admin credentials: `axelencore@mail.ru` / `Ad580dc6axelencore`
- Session management with database persistence
- Role-based access control (admin/user roles)

### Database Schema
- **PostgreSQL** using Replit's Neon service
- Tables: users, projects, boards, columns, tasks, sessions, user_sessions, project_members, task_assignments, comments, attachments, activities
- UUID primary keys for most entities
- Proper foreign key relationships and constraints

### Project Structure
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: API routes with PostgreSQL adapter
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Styling**: Dark theme with glassmorphism effects, purple/blue color scheme

## Key Components

### Database Adapter (`src/lib/adapters/postgresql-adapter.ts`)
- PostgreSQL connection and query management
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Connection pooling for performance

### Authentication (`src/lib/auth.ts`)
- JWT token verification
- Session management
- User role checking

### API Routes
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/projects/*` - Project management
- `/api/boards/*` - Board operations
- `/api/columns/*` - Column management
- `/api/tasks/*` - Task operations

### UI Components
- Layout with sidebar navigation
- AuthModal for authentication
- KanbanBoard with drag-and-drop
- Project and board management interfaces

## Technical Fixes Applied

### Database Issues
1. **Fixed Column Schema Mismatch**: Updated `createColumn` function to use `title` field instead of `name` to match database schema
2. **Resolved Import Conflicts**: Fixed database adapter imports in API routes
3. **SSL Configuration**: Properly configured PostgreSQL connection for Replit's Neon service

### Authentication Issues
1. **JWT Authentication**: Standardized on JWT tokens instead of mixed auth systems
2. **Session Management**: Fixed session creation and validation
3. **Admin Access**: Verified admin authentication works properly

### Environment Configuration
1. **Port Binding**: Configured server to run on 0.0.0.0:5000 for Replit
2. **Environment Variables**: Set up proper DATABASE_URL and PostgreSQL credentials
3. **Next.js Config**: Updated for Replit hosting environment

## Tested Functionality

### âœ… Working Features
- **User Authentication**: Login/logout through web interface and API
- **Project Creation**: Successfully creates projects via API
- **Board Creation**: Successfully creates boards with default columns
- **Database Operations**: All CRUD operations working
- **Web Interface**: Application loads and displays properly

### ðŸ”„ Integration Status
- **Frontend-Backend**: API endpoints working, web interface loads
- **Database**: Full schema applied and operational
- **Authentication**: JWT system functional for both API and UI

## Admin Access

**Admin Login Credentials:**
- Email: `axelencore@mail.ru`
- Password: `Ad580dc6axelencore`

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Access application
http://localhost:5000 (or through Replit's webview)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete UI Testing**: Full end-to-end testing of web interface functionality
2. **Deployment Configuration**: Set up production deployment settings
3. **Performance Optimization**: Review and optimize database queries and UI performance

## User Preferences

- Maintain existing project structure without major refactoring
- Focus on configuration over code changes
- Preserve original design and architecture decisions
- Use PostgreSQL as the primary database

## Important Notes

- Application uses **custom JWT authentication** (not NextAuth)
- Database columns use `title` field for naming (not `name`)
- Server must run on port 5000 with 0.0.0.0 binding for Replit
- PostgreSQL requires SSL connections in Replit environment
